                        <p>Attending an IoT workshop centered on microprocessors and microcontrollers, with a focus on MQTT, provided a comprehensive understanding of IoT communication protocols. By diving into MQTT's lightweight publish-subscribe architecture, I learned how to establish efficient and reliable data exchange between IoT devices and servers. Through practical exercises, I gained hands-on experience in implementing MQTT for real-world applications, enhancing my ability to design scalable and interconnected IoT systems. This workshop deepened my expertise in leveraging microprocessors and microcontrollers within the IoT ecosystem, empowering me to tackle complex challenges with confidence.</p>

                        <p>I've grasped Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts in C and C++. OOPs is about organizing code into objects, each with its own data and functions. It simplifies complex programs by breaking them into manageable parts, making them easier to understand, modify, and reuse.</p>

                        <p>In Java, I've learned Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles, where everything is an object with data and methods. Encapsulation hides data, inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from others, and polymorphism enables objects to take many forms, simplifying code organization and enhancing reusability.</p>
